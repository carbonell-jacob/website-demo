        My name is <strong>Jacob Sioson Carbonell</strong><sup>1</sup>. I am
        currently a 19 year-old Filipino college student living in
        Parañaque<sup>2</sup>. Looking back at my childhood, I can’t seem to
        remember a time when I was ever sad<sup>3</sup>. My parents have always
        told me that when I was young, I was very hyper<sup>4</sup>. It was
        true, I was always the loudest in the house when I played and messed
        around<sup>5</sup>. I had a lot of toys gifted to me by my aunt that I
        would play with every day<sup>6</sup>. My favorite toy is <b>LEGO</b
        ><sup>7</sup>. I remember building random structures instead of
        following the guides and spending hours finding the pieces that I
        needed<sup>8</sup>. I didn’t have access to the internet at a young
        age<sup>9</sup>. They were against it because they believed it would
        affect my development<sup>10</sup>. We had a family computer but they
        put a password on it so I couldn’t use it<sup>11</sup>. The only time I
        remember I used a computer was when I played <i>snail Bob</i> online
        with my father<sup>12</sup>. During my elementary school days in St.
        John Paul II Academy, I don’t remember doing a lot of schoolworks at
        all<sup>13</sup>. I was a very social person, so instead of studying I
        spent most of the time hanging out with my friends<sup>14</sup>. This
        was the reason why I was put into tutoring for multiple subjects by my
        parents<sup>15</sup>. My favorite subject back then was Christian Living
        because it was the easiest and the one I was most familiar with since
        our family is religious<sup>16</sup>. I met two of my closest friends
        during this time<sup>17</sup>. Sometimes we would talk about our
        childhood memories in and out of school, reminiscing the fun times that
        we had together<sup>18</sup>.
        <em>
          <strong
            >Childhood felt like I had all the <u>freedom</u> to do whatever I
            wanted
          </strong>
        </em>
        <sup>19</sup>. I don’t remember crying at all, and I was thankful for
        that because I would remember how truly happy I was<sup>20</sup>.

      <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px">
        I was taught to always be <strong>patient</strong> and have a
        <strong>positive</strong>
        outlook on life by my parents<sup>1</sup>. They always tell me that I
        should always serve as a good example to my younger brother<sup>2</sup>.
        This was when I realized it was time to grow up<sup>3</sup>. I noticed
        that I started to have responsibilities, feel pressure academically, and
        become self-aware<sup>4</sup>. When I was around 9<sup>th</sup> to
        10<sup>th</sup> grade I realized there is more to life than just playing
        around, I had to be serious now<sup>5</sup>. I started to take academics
        seriously in junior and senior high school<sup>6</sup>. I disciplined
        myself to do my work diligently, practiced proper time management, and
        conditioned my mind and body to become more responsible, all while
        applying the principles I learned at home<sup>7</sup>. I did not become
        a top student by doing all of these, in fact, I am just average, but I
        know that these qualities will help me in the long run<sup>8</sup>. I
        met new friends during this time, and through this process
        <strong>I learned more about myself</strong><sup>9</sup>. In contrast to
        my loud and hyper childhood self, I realized I am actually a quiet and
        introverted person<sup>10</sup>. I also found out I like to play musical
        instruments such as piano and guitar, and found new hobbies such as
        drawing, coding, playing video games, cycling, and going to the
        gym<sup>11</sup>. I experimented with a lot of things to find my
        interests<sup>12</sup>. I tried all the clubs in school, watched
        different TV shows and movies genres, and played all kinds of sports
        such as basketball, table tennis, and badminton<sup>13</sup>. In doing
        this I found out I like playing basketball, watching sitcoms and anime,
        and cooking, so I joined the cooking club in my school<sup>14</sup>.
        Being a teenager, I was not exempted from puberty<sup>15</sup>. It was
        kind of a difficult time for me because this was the only time I felt a
        strong feeling of <s>insecurity</s><sup>16</sup>. When people told me I
        looked and sounded different, I felt embarrassed and didn’t want to show
        myself to anyone<sup>17</sup>. I felt really confused and unsafe, but
        thankfully my parents helped and supported me throughout these
        times<sup>18</sup>. Overall, my teenage years are an
        <strong>integral</strong> part of my life<sup>19</sup>. This is when I
        started exploring different things and
        <u><strong>finding myself in the process</strong><sup>20</sup></u>.

      <h3>College Years</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px; margin-bottom: 90px">
        After senior high school, it was time to apply for college<sup>1</sup>.
        I applied to three universities, <b>Far Eastern University Alabang</b>,
        <b>Polytechnic University of the Philippines</b>, and
        <b>University of the East Manila</b><sup>2</sup>. I remember studying
        for the entrance exams for sleepless nights, living off of
        coffee<sup>3</sup>. After finding out that I passed all of them, I
        remembered being so happy it paid off<sup>4</sup>. When I began studying
        in <b><abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr></b
        ><sub>Manila</sub>, I was overwhelmed by how different it is to my
        previous school<sup>5</sup>. The culture of this university is deeper
        and more diverse, the campus is bigger, and there are way more
        students<sup>6</sup>. The learning environment in college is also
        different compared to what I was used to<sup>7</sup>. I realized that I
        am not studying to excel in my grades anymore, I study to
        <u><strong>survive</strong></u><sup>8</sup>. There are times when it gets
        really exhausting and stressful, but I just try my best to remind myself
        that as long as I do my best, everything will be fine<sup>9</sup>. The
        overwhelming amount of work is an opportunity for me to improve my time
        and stress management<sup>10</sup>. I realized that I have to adjust for
        a while<sup>11</sup>. In my first two weeks, I found my circle of
        friends, and I am happy that I am still with them now<sup>12</sup>.
        College wouldn’t be complete without them because they serve as my
        support group<sup>13</sup>. To not get burned out, I try to balance my
        academic and personal life<sup>14</sup>. However, I still struggle
        sometimes because I don’t know how to do it properly<sup>15</sup>.
        Overall, college has been a fun ride so far<sup>16</sup>. There are
        times where I feel lost and overwhelmed, but I know that everything I
        experience here has a <em>purpose</em><sup>17</sup>. It was never going
        to be an easy journey in the first place<sup>18</sup>. Computer science
        has thrown different kinds of challenges at me, and I know it will
        continue to do so in the next 2 years<sup>19</sup>. I just hope that by
        then,
        <strong><em>I will face it as a more well-rounded individual</em></strong><sup>20</sup>.
