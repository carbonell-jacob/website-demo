    <h3>Childhood Years</h3>

        My name is Jacob Sioson Carbonell<sup>1</sup>. I am currently a 19
        year-old Filipino college student living in Parañaque<sup>2</sup>.
        Looking back at my childhood, I can’t seem to remember a time when I was
        ever sad<sup>3</sup>. My parents have always told me that when I was
        young, I was very hyper<sup>4</sup>. It was true, I was always the
        loudest in the house when I played and messed around<sup>5</sup>. I had
        a lot of toys gifted to me by my aunt that I would play with every
        day<sup>6</sup>. My favorite toy is LEGO<sup>7</sup>. I remember
        building random structures instead of following the guides and spending
        hours finding the pieces that I needed<sup>8</sup>. I didn’t have access
        to the internet at a young age<sup>9</sup>. They were against it because
        they believed it would affect my development<sup>10</sup>. We had a
        family computer but they put a password on it so I couldn’t use
        it<sup>11</sup>. The only time I remember I used a computer was when I
        played snail Bob online with my father<sup>12</sup>. During my
        elementary school days in St. John Paul II Academy, I don’t remember
        doing a lot of schoolworks at all<sup>13</sup>. I was a very social
        person, so instead of studying I spent most of the time hanging out with
        my friends<sup>14</sup>. This was the reason why I was put into tutoring
        for multiple subjects by my parents<sup>15</sup>. My favorite subject
        back then was Christian Living because it was the easiest and the one I
        was most familiar with since our family is religious<sup>16</sup>. I met
        two of my closest friends during this time<sup>17</sup>. Sometimes we
        would talk about our childhood memories in and out of school,
        reminiscing the fun times that we had together<sup>18</sup>. Childhood
        felt like I had all the freedom to do whatever I wanted<sup>19</sup>. I
        don’t remember crying at all, and I was thankful for that because I
        would remember how truly happy I was<sup>20</sup>.

      <!-- Teenage years -->
      <h3>Teenage Years</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px">
        I was taught to always be patient and have a positive outlook on life by
        my parents<sup>1</sup>. They always tell me that I should always serve
        as a good example to my younger brother<sup>2</sup>. This was when I
        realized it was time to grow up<sup>3</sup>. I noticed that I started to
        have responsibilities, feel pressure academically, and become
        self-aware<sup>4</sup>. When I was around 9th to 10th grade I realized
        there is more to life than just playing around, I had to be serious
        now<sup>5</sup>. I started to take academics seriously in junior and
        senior high school<sup>6</sup>. I disciplined myself to do my work
        diligently, practiced proper time management, and conditioned my mind
        and body to become more responsible, all while applying the principles I
        learned at home<sup>7</sup>. I did not become a top student by doing all
        of these, in fact, I am just average, but I know that these qualities
        will help me in the long run<sup>8</sup>. I met new friends during this
        time, and through this process I learned more about myself<sup>9</sup>.
        In contrast to my loud and hyper childhood self, I realized I am
        actually a quiet and introverted person<sup>10</sup>. I also found out I
        like to play musical instruments such as piano and guitar, and found new
        hobbies such as drawing, coding, playing video games, cycling, and going
        to the gym<sup>11</sup>. I experimented with a lot of things to find my
        interests<sup>12</sup>. I tried all the clubs in school, watched
        different TV shows and movies genres, and played all kinds of sports
        such as basketball, table tennis, and badminton<sup>13</sup>. In doing
        this I found out I like playing basketball, watching sitcoms and anime,
        and cooking, so I joined the cooking club in my school<sup>14</sup>.
        Being a teenager, I was not exempted from puberty<sup>15</sup>. It was
        kind of a difficult time for me because this was the only time I felt a
        strong feeling of insecurity<sup>16</sup>. When people told me I looked
        and sounded different, I felt embarrassed and didn’t want to show myself
        to anyone<sup>17</sup>. I felt really confused and unsafe, but
        thankfully my parents helped and supported me throughout these
        times<sup>18</sup>. Overall, my teenage years are an integral part of my
        life<sup>19</sup>. This is when I started exploring different things and
        finding myself in the process<sup>20</sup>.

      <!-- College experience -->
      <h3>College Years</h3>
      <p style="text-indent: 70px">
        After senior high school, it was time to apply for college<sup>1</sup>.
        I applied to three universities, Far Eastern University Alabang,
        Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and University of the East
        Manila<sup>2</sup>. I remember studying for the entrance exams for
        sleepless nights, living off of coffee<sup>3</sup>. After finding out
        that I passed all of them, I remembered being so happy it paid
        off<sup>4</sup>. When I began studying in UE Manila, I was overwhelmed
        by how different it is to my previous school<sup>5</sup>. The culture of
        this university is deeper and more diverse, the campus is bigger, and
        there are way more students<sup>6</sup>. The learning environment in
        college is also different compared to what I was used to<sup>7</sup>. I
        realized that I am not studying to excel in my grades anymore, I study
        to survive<sup>8</sup>. There are times when it gets really exhausting
        and stressful, but I just try my best to remind myself that as long as I
        do my best, everything will be fine<sup>9</sup>. The overwhelming amount
        of work is an opportunity for me to improve my time and stress
        management<sup>10</sup>. I realized that I have to adjust for a
        while<sup>11</sup>. In my first two weeks, I found my circle of friends,
        and I am happy that I am still with them now<sup>12</sup>. College
        wouldn’t be complete without them because they serve as my support
        group<sup>13</sup>. To not get burned out, I try to balance my academic
        and personal life<sup>14</sup>. However, I still struggle sometimes
        because I don’t know how to do it properly<sup>15</sup>. Overall,
        college has been a fun ride so far<sup>16</sup>. There are times where I
        feel lost and overwhelmed, but I know that everything I experience here
        has a purpose<sup>17</sup>. It was never going to be an easy journey in
        the first place<sup>18</sup>. Computer science has thrown different
        kinds of challenges at me, and I know it will continue to do so in the
        next 2 years<sup>19</sup>. I just hope that by then, I will face it as a
        more well-rounded individual<sup>20</sup>.
